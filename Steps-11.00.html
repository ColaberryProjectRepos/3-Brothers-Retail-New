
Tweaking the Data

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:

table, we must clean this data up. This was brought over with European dates
(day, month, year), but we need to make these American dates (month, day,
year). To do this we will split them by delimitator and reconstruct them. Make
sure to rename the delimitated columns so they are easier to keep up with. We
will also change the type from number to text for ease of working with the
data. Once the dates are rebuilt in a US format, we will swap the data types to
dates. Also, please remove the two empty columns at the end of the original
data. Please follow the GIF below.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><img src="https://app.colaberry.com/uploads/ProjectStepsImages/1538/11/1.gif" style="width: 50%;"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:
